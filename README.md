# Three.js Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of Three.js projects! This repository showcases various 3D web applications and experiments built using the powerful Three.js library.

## 🌟 About

This repository serves as a playground for exploring the capabilities of Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in web browsers. Here, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate different aspects of 3D rendering, animation, and interactive experiences.

## 🚀 Projects

Here's a list of some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

1. **Physics Playground**: A 3D simulation combining Three.js and Cannon.js for realistic physics interactions.
   
(Will be adding more projects as they are developed)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): The core 3D graphics library
- [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/): The underlying technology for rendering
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): The programming language used
- Additional libraries specific to each project (e.g., Cannon.js for physics)

## 🏁 Getting Started

To explore these projects:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/threejs-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser or use a local server.
